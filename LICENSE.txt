      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but

      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by the
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to work
      (an example is provided in Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or
      Object form, that is based on (or derived from) Work and for which
      the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to interfaces of,
      Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in Work by copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      copyright owner. For purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      by Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

      designated in writing by copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to terms and conditions of
      the License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to terms and conditions of
      the License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed files; and

      (c) You must retain, in Source form of any Derivative Works
          that you distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from Source form of Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          Derivative Works, in and of themselves; and

      (d) If Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in and of themselves;
          within at least three
          years, to cause modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed files; and
          retain, in Source form of any Derivative Works that you distribute,
          all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from
          Source form of Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          Derivative Works, in and of themselves; and
          within at least three years, to cause modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed files; and

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in Work by You to
      Licensor shall be under terms and conditions of this License,
      without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing
      origin of Work and reproducing content of NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining
      appropriateness of using or redistributing Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of use or inability to use
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.
      However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your
      own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any
      other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend,
      and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or
      claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any
      such warranty or additional liability.
